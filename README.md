# Project-3---Predicting-Smoker-Status

By Emerie Danson, Sam Mathieu, Eve Dean

The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that guess smoker status based on a variety of health metrics. To achieve this, we made several iterations of logistic models, nearest neighbors classifiers, and decision trees, including gradient boosted decision trees. We also used ensembling to combine our models. 

Data used in this project came from a Kaggle dataset using data from the Korean Government. It featured health data such as: 

*   height
*   weight
*   hearing
*   eyesight
*   weight
*   blood pressure 
*   hemoglobin
*   urine protein
*   cholesterol
*   Dental caries
*   tartar
*   & more!
